 omen_ius:1 "Ius"
 omen_ius_desc:4 "Ius the Extremely Agitated is a god of which the statues can be seen throughout Valenwood and parts of Elsweyr, said to answer the prayers of animals. He is portrayed as a misshapen humanoid, carrying a rod and a large set of scales. Legend has it that, answering to an ox's cry for help, eating the farmer that threatened its life and then disappearing. Another myth speaks of a vengeful pet wombat who asked Ius to block the gate of Rockcreek's palace with an equipment store, causing the royal family to go mad and eat one another (and the wombat)."

 omen_wilderking_desc:4 "The Wilderking has almost complete divine power over nature and as such controls the balance between nature and its creatures. This can be seen by his control over Lurchers at his court which are used to guard him. The Wilderking or queen is always mantled by a mortal. The mortal must be born with a powerful control over nature, and will be brought to the Wilderking's Court by the order of fate. Once mantled, the previous mortal dies and the newly mantled mortal loses all memories of their life."

Unlike the Silvenar, however, the Green Lady will protect her people with far more extreme methods, especially when the Silvenar isn't around to restrain her."
