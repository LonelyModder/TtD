 form_palatine:0 "Form the Kingdom of Pellitine"
 form_palatine_desc:0 "The southern clans of Elsweyr prefer to deal with their enemies in diplomatic way and are generally richer than their northern cusins due to proximity of lucrative trade routes.

The walls of Dune or a famous Moon Gates are clear material evidence of existance of the Khajiiti Empire but the question remains. Why it fell? Why we have so little sources from the period? And more important can it be reformed?"
