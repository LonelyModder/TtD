 #Modded Religions
 elven_pantheon:0 "Anuic"
 desc_elven_pantheon:0 "The early faith of the elves was centered on the worship of ancestors, which over time turned into the cult of the most powerful of them, such as Trinimac, Syrabane, and Phynaster. The cult of Magnus, the creator of the plans of the mortal world, was also strong. However, nothing compares to the worship of Auri-El, the sun god victor over the fraud god Lorkhan and the creator of the first elven kingdom."
 oldelven_pantheon:0 "Psijic"
 desc_oldelven_pantheon:0 "In the meretic era, the sect of mages broke away from the high elves on religious grounds. They considered it heresy to abandon the worship of their ancestors in favor of the worship of a select few who had attained divinity."
 nedic_pantheon:0 "Shezzaric"
 desc_nedic_pantheon:0 "Nedic beliefs differ from tribe to tribe. They are known to worship both Aedra and Daedra but the deity with the most followers is definitely the Shezzar (beter known under the name Lorkhan). Some rituals require human sacrifice. It is also known that some strains have contacts with the Hargravens sect."
 goblin_pantheon:0 "Goblin"
 desc_goblin_pantheon:0 "We don't have much detail about the goblins' faith, but the fact is that they mostly worship Malacatha. Some of them also have objects related to the cult of Hircine, so it can be concluded that they mainly worship Daedra."
 green_pantheon:0 "Green Pact"
 desc_green_pantheon:0 "Wood elves have quite radical beliefs. According to a pact with the nature deity Y'ephre, they were not allowed to eat or harm plants, so they developed the habit of cannibalism and usually wear leather clothes. The building material of their homes is imported from outside the Valenwood forest."
 deadric_pantheon:0 "Deadric"
 desc_deadric_pantheon:0 "The Daedric Lords are those et'Ada who did not take part in the creation of the mortal world but created domains out of themselves in Oblivion (sphere of existance closest to the mortal plane). There are also accounts of other et'Ada becoming Daedric Princes after the creation of Mundus like for example Meridia, which also involves the creation of their own realms of Oblivion."
 codeofmalacath_pantheon:0 "Code of Malacath"
 desc_codeofmalacath_pantheon:0 "Set of rules that followers of Malacath, must abide to like do not steal, do not kill, do not attack without reason, fight with honor, protect your tribe.

 khajiiti_pantheon:0 "Khajiiti"
 desc_khajiiti_pantheon:0 "The belief of the Khajiit is in a sense a combination of the deities of the neighboring races with a particular emphasis on the planet's moons, which are important in the breeding process of the catmen. The shape an adult khajiit will take literally depends on Messer and Secundas phase."
 hist_pantheon:0 "Hist"
 desc_hist_pantheon:0 "Hist trees may look like mere pieces of wood, but they are actually a fully sentient species, most likely from the oblivion dimension. In addition to the Hists, the Argonians worship Sithis, a remnant of their ancient beliefs from before the mysterious religious reform."
 nordic_pantheon:0 "Nordic"
 desc_nordic_pantheon:0 "Nords divide the history of the world into cycles, therefore their gods are divided into three groups. Dead ones like Shor who sacrificed themselves to start the current cycle. Gods taking caro of the current cycle like Kyne (she is especially revered) and gods who will end the cycle like Alduin."
 imperial_pantheon:0 "Devines"
 desc_imperial_pantheon:0 "Faith in Eight Devine Aedra was formed to unify elven and human inhabitants of Cyrodiil. The pantheon consists of the gods that both sides recognize as politically correct. For example Shor also known as Shezzar or simply Lorkhan was not included as elves believe that he stole their immortality."
 druidic_pantheon:0 "Druidic"
 desc_druidic_pantheon:0 "Druids follow Y'ffre True Way (later known as Druidism) in which the eponymous god took the forefront of their faith.

 wyrdite_pantheon:0 "Wyrdite"
 desc_wyrdite_pantheon:0 "Wyrd and the Druids share common root but at some point they were devided by ideological differences.

The wyrd in oposition to druidism is very anti elven as one of the reasons for the schism were the 'excesses of the elves'. "
 nirnic_pantheon:0 "Nirnist"
 desc_nirnic_pantheon:0 "The religion of the Deep Elves is a very complex topic. They refuse to worship the gods or the daedra cause they believe them to be mere mortals that got the godly powers. They believe that only Nirni the world as a whole is worthy of worship and as such the believers are morally obliged to study the world and uncover all it's secrets."
 night_pantheon:0 "Night Cults"
 desc_night_pantheon:0 "It is common misconception that vampires and werewolfs worship Molag Bal and Hercine exclusively. When you are one of the most wanted beings on Tamriel any new ally is precious. Thats why you can see vampires worshiping Clavicus Vile or Nocturnal. There exists even prominent cult of Sanguine among vampires from Elsweyr."
 idealmasters_pantheon:0 "Ideal Masters"
