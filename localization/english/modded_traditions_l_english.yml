Additionally they also kept their knowledge of arcane arts."
 necrom_path_3b:0 "Lichdom"
 necrom_path_3b_desc:0 "Becoming the lich is for the most of practitioners the final achivement of their career. After all who do not want to be immortal, powerfull and without any debt to some deadra. The process itself requires a lot of sacrifices that need to be killed in a brutal way and it is only first step. After that soul must be pulled from the body and stored in an object that necromancer keep with himself. After some time soul returns to original body and we get a self reanimated corpse or more commonly lich. "
 necrom_path_4b:0 "Indirect Control"
 necrom_path_4b_desc:0 "By having the powerful undead under your command the amount of the dead you can control rises exponentially. This also protects an army in case of casters death which usually is a heavy blow. This way undead army can be devided on units that can work independently from a main army."
 necrom_states_path_end_bonus:0 "The Dark Arts"
 necrom_states_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Necromancy is not as some says easy road. The necromancers have very difficult way ahead of them from day one. If you overcome initial obstacles and be persistant enaugh you can achieve almost anything you want. You need also be mindful not to end up as a corpse yourself."

 daedra_philosophy:1 "Daedric Traditions"
 daedra_philosophydesc:3 "It is very dangerous to deal with Daedric Lords. These immortal beings rule over the other dimensions and often interact with mortals. One must remember that these powerful demons always have their own motives and can betray you immidiately after you overgrown your usefulness."
 tradition_unlock_requirement_daedra:0 "You need to officially worship correct Daedric Prince or gain support of Daedra Worshippers. "
 #Traditions
 daedra_path_1:0 "Step by Step"
 daedra_path_1_desc:0 "It is ill advised to start summoning powerful deadra too early. Deadric creatures are very powerfull and challenge is not in bringing them in but keeping them under control. There are a lot of examples of unexperienced individuals that ended up killed by the deadra that was supposed to serve them."
 daedra_path_2:0 "Filling the Ranks"
 daedra_path_2_desc:0 "In oposition to undead the deadra do not require large quantities to make a difference. In many armies it is a common sight to see deadra fighting alongside battlemages. The deadra summoning is not viewed even half as badly as necromancy so using the demonic creatures by mages is fairly common."
 daedra_path_2a:0 "Face of a Demon"
 daedra_path_2a_desc:0 "The daerda have all manner of shapes and sizes. Thou most clans tend to serve one demonic prince like Golden Saints serve Sheogorath most of demonic beings do not attach themselves to one prince. Actually it is far easier to summon clanfear or scamp than more humanoid daedra. The more animalistic creatures tend to have weaker wills and are easier to command."
 daedra_path_3a:0 "Power of Elements"
 daedra_path_3a_desc:0 "By far the most unrully kind of deadra is atronach. They tie themselves to an element like fire or electricity. Basicly fire atronach look like a humanoid made of flames and so on. They tend to have loose loyalty even to their daedric princes and change masters fairly often."
 daedra_path_4a:0 "Demonic Adaptability"
 daedra_path_4a_desc:0 "Deadra are not limited by human physiology. If you need to operate in forest you can summon Perthan(Spider Daedra), in hilly terrain ogrims can be useful and so on. The lords of oblivion have all menageries of different creatures. Deadra are not limited by hunger and do not need to rest."
 daedra_path_2b:0 "Oblivion Gate"
 daedra_path_2b_desc:0 "Sometimes during times of crisis or when a dadric prince needs a champion the oblivion gate can be opened. It can look different depending on a plane of oblivion it leeds to (it can be a burning gate or a simple book). Most of the times the gates are opened by daedra but powerful individuals can also open them under specific conditions."
 daedra_path_3b:0 "Cheese for Everyone"
 daedra_path_3b_desc:0 "The daedra can eat human food but not because it needs to but because they like the taste. Soldiers that do not have to eat or sleep and unlike undead can fulfill more complicated orders are a dream of every tamriellic general. Most of cities gives up without a  fight when seing the demons surrounding them."
 daedra_path_4b:0 "Daedric Siege Engines"
 daedra_path_4b_desc:0 "Rarely seen on Tamriel. They are large partially santient machines size of a dragon (sometimes even bigger). For example Mechrunes Dagon posesses a large metalic canon that can muve on spider like legs and can shoot beams of plasma. This randers the walls and other defences obsolete."
 daedra_path_5b:0 "Immortality"
 daedra_path_5b_desc:0 "Daedra cannot die. When her body is destroyed her spirit returns to the waters of oblivion (for example the magma in Mechrunes Dagon realm). There the deadra can be reimbodied thou it can take a lot of time depending on a level of power the daedra posess. The death from mortal hands for a daedra is very shameful as they believe mortals to be lesser beings."
 daedra_states_path_end_bonus:0 "Dangerous Deals"
 daedra_states_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "The dealings with a beings like the daedra are dangerous from one very simple reason. The Princes of Oblivion usually have their own plans and mortals are only pawns for them. After all they can live forever and maybe that plan of yours took you your whole life but for them it's only another distraction."
