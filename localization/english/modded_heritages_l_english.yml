 #Modded Heritages
 altmer_heritage:0 "Altmer Heritage"
 altmer_heritage_desc:0 "The Altmers are reputed to be the oldest and most advanced Elvish civilization on Tamriel. Most likely, in the case of the first statement it is not true, but because their homeland is a natural fortress, they could focus on internal development without the need for constant rivalry and wars. Not to mention the occasional attacks by the Sloads and Moarmers that forced the development of the navy."
 ayleid_heritage:0 "Ayleid Heritage"
 ayleid_heritage_desc:0 "The Ayleids, or cousins of the Altmers from the center of the continent, had to contend with intense human expansion in the region.

 nede_heritage:0 "Nedic Heritage"

 goblin_heritage:0 "Goblin Heritage"
 goblin_heritage_desc:0 "Goblins are almost everywhere, their appearance makes them suspected of being related to the orcs, which is not true as they are older than them.

 bosmer_heritage:0 "Bosmer Heritage"
 bosmer_heritage_desc:0 "Centuries ago the Bosmerians made a so-called green pact with the nature deity Y'ephre. One of the conditions is respect for plants.

The building blocks of their cities have to be imported or houses are formed from trees without destroying them."
 orcish_heritage:0 "Orcish Heritage"
 orcish_heritage_desc:0 "Orcs form a militaristic society divided into tribes that values, above all, strength. Many of the rituals they follow are designed to educate perfect warriors.

 minotauric_heritage:0 "Minotauric Heritage"
 minotauric_heritage_desc:0 "Minotaurs form a tribal society divided into clans. They avoid other races due to frequent persecution.

 imga_heritage:0 "Imga Heritage"
 imga_heritage_desc:0 "The Imga are a race of sentient monkeys from Valenwood. As a rule, they are rather cowardly and run away from a fight. They are known to imitate high elf culture to a rather comical degree. For example, they dye their fur and wear meaningless titles."
 argonian_heritage:0 "Argonian Heritage"
 argonian_heritage_desc:0 "Their innate resilience and ability to breathe underwater make Argonians difficult opponents in a defensive war.

 khajiit_heritage:0 "Khajiit Heritage"

 breton_heritage:0 "Breton Heritage"
 breton_heritage_desc:0 "The Bretons are the result of crossbreeding of man and mer. They live mostly in High Rock where the elven laws were more liberal than in other parts of Tamriel.
